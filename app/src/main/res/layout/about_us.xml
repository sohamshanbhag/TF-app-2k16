        android:text="Born in 1998 with the motto of promoting technology, scientific thinking and innovation, Techfest has surpassed 18 golden years of creating an unmatched aura of a science and technology spectacle year after year at the IIT Bombay campus at Powai, Mumbai. It is today well established as Asia\'s Largest Science and Technology festival, with more than 1,45,000 people in attendance and a reach of over 2500 colleges across India and over 500 overseas.
        \n\nIn its endeavour to provide an international platform to the youth to showcase their talents and skill sets in fierce competitions, display cutting edge technology and research from all over the globe, have world renowned personalities motivate the youth and promote solutions to alleviate the common man of his banal yet significant problems, Techfest strives for one and all to get inspired and look up to.
        \n\nTechfest has diversified into an organisation that apart from showcasing the pinnacle of technical advancement, also strives for the betterment of the society with unique initiatives. Be it a campaign focussed at promotion of futuristic and eco-friendly technologies or technical innovations aimed at escalating and sustainable India. These initiatives to address social and environmental causes have set Techfest apart from any other college festival and added a whole new dimension to this organisation working on a non-profit basis.
        \n\nTechfest is entirely managed by students of IIT Bombay with a three-tier team structure. The core committee consists of 23 members comprising of 1 Overall Coordinator at the helm and 22 Managers. Techfest is a true believer in the concept of a team of equals. Every brickbat is shared equally by the team as is in every bouquet. Although every aspect of Techfest is no closer to one manager than the other but, for smooth functioning, certain portfolios are allotted to every manager.
        \n\nThe portfolios can be broadly categorised into two sections - administration and events. The administrative portfolios primarily include tasks like accounts, infrastructure, media and marketing, hospitality and publicity. The events portfolios include responsibility for each of the numerous happenings and initiatives taken by Techfest each year. A team of over 800 Coordinators and Organisers along with their respective managers work in sync to execute and implement the splendid spectacle called Techfest."/>
